           <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span> Spacious Home to Share
          </h1>
          <p class="about-me__info--para">
            I live alone in a 3100 sq ft home, a short walk to Circle View Elementary and Marina High School.
            I am seeking a renter for a master bedroom and office, a room that used to be a bedroom, but lacks a closet and a window.
            Your private rooms and bathroom are 450+ sq. ft, but we would share an additional 1450+ sq. ft: laundry room, big pantry, plus space
            in the garage, and 2 spots on the driveway. Quite cul-de-sac, 15951 Willett Ln.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me__info--para">
            My daughter and son, now honors/AP students at Marina, need to feel comfortable to stay and/or live here. A small family would be ideal.
            If I think my children would feel safe with you living here, then we can consider the rest.
            While I really want to meet an intelligent, kind, and affectionate woman, rest assured that I do not want intimacy until I find her, and definitely not with a tenant.
          </p><p class="about-me__info--para">
            Boysenberries, lemon grass, cherry tomatoes, and a few strawberries have been growing for years.
            I am adding basil, cilantro, jalapeÃ±o, raspberry, english lavender, chamomile, mint, kanna, lions mane, another mushroom; and jasmine and other flowers that are not for eating :)
            There is still plenty of room, if you want to plant something.
          </p>
          <p class="about-me__info--para">
            The shared space has the basics, with room for more, if you have furniture and stuff. I like cats, but don't have any pets currently. Your pets are welcome, if they are good.
            It really needs a good cleaning, and some minor upkeep like outlet covers and new detectors, but that won't take long, once I know someone is ready to move in.
            Unless my children come back, I will be the only other person here. $3K/mo. and half of utilities (I don't use much) is a deal if you like the space, and will be lower if my children spend time here.

            More important than how much rent is, will be how we get along. No smoking, vaping, incense, or similar. I have been eating healthy, but boring goulash style.
            A jalapeÃ±o, 1/2 onion, and garlic are often mixed with veggies, meat and carbs. Restaurant food is often too salty.

          <p class="about-me__info--para">
            I like background music with deep bass, but not a monotonous boom boom boom. Many different styles of music, but Drum & Bass is my favorite.
            I am quiet, intelligent, and good with children. Good in the do-the-right-thing, adult way, not trying to be their
            friend.
            I am good at explaining things, speaking correctly, and helping people. I rarely drink alcohol, and don't take any
            prescriptions that people abuse.

          I'll be adding more, but it's getting late tonight.
